# File Labs

A free, dual-pane file manager for Windows 11, with a copy engine that shows what it is doing.

- **Two panes, with tabs** — browser-style tabs in each pane, `Tab` to switch panes,
  `Ctrl+U` to swap them, drag and drop between panes and to/from Explorer (the wheel scrolls the list
  under a drag).
- **Transfers you can watch** — copy and move run through the Ferry engine: one scan up front
  (totals and every conflict at once), one conflict decision per job, pause and cancel, a live
  speed chart, one queue per destination drive. Same-drive moves are renames.
- **Optional verification** — reads source and copy back and compares xxHash3 digests; on a move,
  a source whose copy doesn't match is kept.
- **Quick View** — `Space` previews images, video, audio, PDF and text without opening anything.
- **Stash and Backup Labs backups** (`.stash`, `.bkl`, and their older `.zip` names) — the preview
  shows what is inside without restoring anything: apps, profiles and mail folders with their message
  counts, or files, size and where they came from. Enter opens one in its app when that is installed
  (Stash 2.1+, Backup Labs 1.3.0+).
- **Films from Reel** — with Reel (1.13.0+) installed, a video in its library gets a line above the
  preview: poster, title and year (or series and episode), watched or not, and a link to Reel.
- **Folder sizes** in the list, file versions for `.exe`/`.dll`, and a recency tint on dates.
- **Views** — Details, List and three icon sizes with Explorer's own thumbnails (`Ctrl+Shift+1…5`).
  Shortcuts to folders can be sorted with the folders (Settings → Files).
- **The real right-click menu** when you want it — Send to, Open with, 7-Zip and other shell
  extensions, with a View submenu on the folder's own menu — or a compact one that matches the app.
  Paste on a folder, or on a shortcut to one, puts the files in it.
- **Default file manager** (optional) — folders, drives and `Win+E` open in File Labs. Switching
  it off (or uninstalling) hands them back to whatever had them before. "Win+E opens File Labs" can be
  switched off on its own, to keep Win+E for File Explorer.
- Acrylic, tint or solid backdrop, with an opacity floor so text stays readable.

No account, no telemetry, nothing it talks to online.

## Building

Needs the .NET 8 SDK; the installer needs [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

```powershell
.\build.ps1                 # dist\FileLabs-<version>-setup.exe
.\build.ps1 -SkipInstaller  # self-contained app in dist\app
```

`FileLabs.exe --selftest` runs the copy engine on real files in a temp folder; exit code 0 = pass.

The version lives only in `FileExplorer.csproj`.
